# 🔬 Deep Learning for Early Detection of Skin Cancer

## Project Overview

This project details the development and evaluation of a deep learning model for the automated **binary classification of skin lesions** as either **Benign** or **Malignant**. The system utilizes a state-of-the-art **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, specifically **ResNet50** via **transfer learning**, to provide an accurate, reliable, and clinically-aware diagnostic aid.

## Key Features & Objectives

The primary goals of this project were centered on creating a clinically useful tool:

* [cite_start]**High Accuracy:** Achieve strong classification performance by leveraging a pre-trained **ResNet50** backbone[cite: 43].
* [cite_start]**Clinical Applicability:** Strategically optimize the model to prioritize **Recall (Sensitivity)**, aiming to **minimize False Negatives (missed cancers)**[cite: 44, 106].
* [cite_start]**Interpretability (Trustworthy AI):** Ensure the model's decision-making is transparent using **Grad-CAM heatmaps**[cite: 45, 112].

## 📊 Results and Performance

### Core Metrics

[cite_start]The model demonstrated **strong discriminatory power** as evidenced by the high Area Under the Curve (AUC)[cite: 27, 102].

| Metric | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Validation Accuracy** | [cite_start]$\approx 92\%$ [cite: 27, 101] |
| **AUC (Area Under the Curve)** | [cite_start]**0.9752** [cite: 27, 102] |
| **F1-Score (Optimal)** | 0.924 (at threshold 0.200)  |

### Threshold Optimization for Clinical Safety

[cite_start]To mitigate the clinical risk associated with **False Negatives (missed cancers)**, a threshold optimization was performed, shifting from a default threshold (0.5) to a **High Recall Threshold (0.100)**[cite: 107, 108].

| Metric | Initial (Default 0.5) | Optimized (High Recall 0.100) | Improvement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **False Negatives** | [cite_start]33 [cite: 104] | [cite_start]**13** [cite: 110] | [cite_start]**$> 60\%$ Reduction** [cite: 28, 110] |
| **Recall (Sensitivity)** | 89.00% (at 0.5)  | [cite_start]**95.67%** [cite: 111] | Significantly increased |

### Model Interpretability (Grad-CAM)

[cite_start]**Grad-CAM heatmaps** confirm the model's trustworthiness by visually demonstrating that it focuses on the **relevant pathological features within the lesion area** when making predictions, rather than relying on external artifacts[cite: 29, 113].
